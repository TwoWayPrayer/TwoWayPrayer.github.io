								<h3><b><i>Welcome & Opening Prayer</i></b></h3>

							    <p>Welcome to our Zoom Tenth and Eleventh Step Guidance Meeting.<br> 
									My name is ___________ and I will be the moderator for our group today.<br>
									<br>
									Let’s open with a moment of silence, to invite God into our hearts, followed by the Serenity Prayer.
									You are welcome to unmute as you wish.<br>
									<br>
									[SILENCE FOR A COUNT OF 5-10 BREATHS]<br>
									<br>
									SERENITY PRAYER: 
									<br>God, grant me the serenity
									<br>to accept the things I cannot change,<br> 
									courage to change the things I can,<br>
									and the wisdom to know the difference.<br>
									<br>
									Leader: Thy will not mine be done!</p>



									<h3><b><i>Meeting Intro & Format</i></b></h3>
							    <p>This is a Tenth and Eleventh Step Guidance Group focused on the practice of Two Way Prayer. 
									We welcome any member of a 12 Step fellowship, regardless of race, creed, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other reason.<br>
									<br>
									Welcome everyone! We are so grateful that you have joined us today.
									<br>
									<br>
									Together, we are seeking to deepen our conscious contact with the God of our own understanding through an enhanced practice of the last 3 steps of the 12 step programs. 
									We do this by following the original program of AA, based on the Oxford Group, which included the principles of the 4 Absolutes and the practice of written guidance or Two Way Prayer. 
									Ultimately, this direct and personal experience of listening to our inner voice — “the still, small Voice” of calm that is within each of us, will enable us to be of maximum service to God, other people and ourselves.
									<br>

								</p>



								<h3><b><i>The 4 Absolutes</i></b></h3>
							    <p>The spiritual disciplines of the 4 Absolutes and the last 3 steps are an important foundation for our group.
									<br>
									<br>
									The 4 Absolutes, used by the Oxford Group, were the guiding spiritual principles used to determine if one’s decisions, thoughts or actions are in alignment with God’s-will or motivated by self-will. These ideals called for: 
								
									<i>Absolute Honesty, Absolute Unselfishness, Absolute Purity, Absolute Love.</i>
								
									Although recognized as impossible to attain, when the 4 Standards are maintained faithfully as goals, they become powerful transformers of conduct, character, and consciousness.
									<p style="font-family:courier;">[NOTE TO TECH: Post the link for the Four Absolutes and the Oxford Group in the chat box. Then share the screen for the reading of the Four Absolutes and 10-11-12 steps.]</p>
								</p>


								<h3><b><u>4 Absolutes</u></b></h3>
							    <p>LEADER: Who would like to read the 4 Absolutes?
									<br>
									<p style="color:burlywood">[READER BEGINS]</p>
									<br>
									My name is ______ and these are the 4 Absolutes:
									<br>
									<br>
									<ul>
										<li><b>ABSOLUTE HONESTY:</b> Not deceiving others or ourselves in word, deed and thoughts.
										<br></li>
										<li><b>ABSOLUTE PURITY (FORGIVENESS):</b> Freedom from being controlled by our desires or our fears and insecurities.
										<br></li>
										<li><b>ABSOLUTE UNSELFISHNESS:</b> Seeking what is right and true ahead of what I want in every situation. A commitment to fairness and justice and a willingness to share.
										<br></li>
										<li><b>ABSOLUTE LOVE (FAITH):</b> The feeling of affection, benevolence or devotion created through acts of selfless unconditional giving to another person according to one’s highest spiritual values.
										<br></li>
										<br>
										<p style="color:burlywood">[READER STOPS]</p>
										
									</ul>

								<h3><b><u>Steps 10, 11 & 12</u></b></h3>
							    <p>Who would like to read the Steps 10, 11 and 12 from the Original Manuscript?
									<br>
									<p style="color:burlywood">[READER BEGINS]</p>
									<br>
									My name is ______ and these are the last three Steps of the 12-Step Program from the Original Manuscript:
									<br><br>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Step 10:</b> Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
										<br></li>
										<li><b>Step 11:</b> Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, praying only for the knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
										<br></li>
										<li><b>Step 12:</b> Having had a spiritual experience as the result of this course of action, we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
										<br></li>
										<br>
										<p style="color:burlywood">[READER STOPS]</p>
										<br>
									</ul>
									Leader: Thank you.
								</p>




							    <p>While we remain focused here today on these last three Steps, we continue to work and to make daily use of the other spiritual tools gained through all the Steps outside of this group.
									<br>
									<br>
									
									<u>SEVENTH TRADITION</u>

									<br>
									<br>
									In accordance with the Seventh Tradition, our group is self-supporting through our own contributions, neither soliciting nor accepting outside donations. The information will be placed in the chat box.
									<br>
									
									<p style="font-family:courier;">
										[Tech: Please post this in the chat the 7th Tradition link <a href="#">via PayPal]</a> 

									</p>
								</p>



								<h3><b><i>Group Process</i></b></h3>
							    <p>Our meeting lasts for approximately one hour. As a group, we will individually practice writing Two Way prayer. After writing, we will share our guidance with each other in smaller breakout rooms. We will then return to the larger group at the conclusion of our meeting for any announcements, and/or feedback.
									<br>
									<br>
									All sharing is completely voluntary and confidential. We ask for this to be respected by one and all.
									<br>
									<br>
									Please have some paper and something to write with. Many of us come with a question or topic of concern to take to God for guidance today. Or, you may simply ask: “God, what is Your will for me today?”  As thoughts come into your mind, write them down. Guidance can take the form of images, thoughts, feelings or inspiration.
								</p>



								<h3><b><i>Assign Reader for <a href="twoWayPrayer.html">How to Listen to God.</a></i></b></h3>
							    <p>	
									Who would like to read the pamphlet How to Listen to God?
									<br>
									Thank you ___________ for volunteering to read today. Please read the first 6 instructions before we stop to write our guidance. 
									The rest of the pamphlet will be read after writing time is completed.
									<br>
										<p style="color:burlywood">READ FIRST HALF OF HOW TO LISTEN TO GOD up to the 6th point</p>
								 	<br>
									LEADER: We will now follow these directions and write together for 10 minutes. During Two Way Prayer, meditative music will be played in the background. Anyone who wants to meditate in silence, is welcome to turn down their volume for the 10 minutes and return when the timer is up.
									<br><br>
									At the end of the 10 minutes the music will stop. Feel free to continue writing longer if you still feel inspired to do so.  
									<br><br>
									Start writing now.
								</p>

								<h3><b><i>Instruction for Breakout Rooms</a></i></b></h3>

									Rooms are set to have a 3-4 person minimum for safety. The main room will remain open, and you are welcome to return at any time for any reason by clicking the blue “leave room” button.
