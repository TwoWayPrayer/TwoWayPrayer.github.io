									<h4>A Prayer For Inner Peace</h4>
									<p> Please help me to clear my mind and emotions of negativity and drama. 
                                        Please uplift my thoughts to the level of true spiritual understanding, compassion and Divine Wisdom.

									<h4>First Step Prayer</h4>
									<p> Dear Lord,
                                        I admit that I am powerless over my addiction. 
                                        I admit that my life is unmanageable when I try to control it. 
                                        Help me this day to understand the true meaning of powerlessness. 
                                        Remove from me all denial of my addiction.
                                    </p>

									<p> My Creator,<br>
                                        Today, I ask for help with my addiction. 
                                        Denial has kept me from seeing how powerless I am & how my life is unmanageable. 
                                        I need to learn & remember that I have an incurable illness & that abstinence is the only way to deal with it.

                                        to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy love & Thy way of life.<br>
                                        May I do Thy will always!<br>

									<p> Dear God,<br>
                                        It is I who has made my life a mess. I have done it, but I cannot undo it.<br>
                                        My mistakes are mine & I will begin a searching & fearless moral inventory.<br>
                                        I will write down my wrongs, but I will also include that which is good. I pray for the strength to complete the task.

                                        Assure me, & be with me, in this Step, for without this Step I cannot progress in my recovery.<br>

									<p> Perpetual quietness of heart.<br>
                                        It is to have no trouble.<br>
                                        It is never to be fretted or vexed, irritable or sore;<br>
                                        to wonder at nothing that is done to me,<br>
                                        to feel nothing done against me.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        It is to be at rest when nobody praises me,<br>
                                        and when I am blamed or despised,<br>
                                        to have a blessed home in myself<br>
                                        where I can go in and shut the door<br>
                                        and kneel to my Father in secret and be at peace,<br>
                                        as in a deep sea of calmness,<br>

									<p> Lord, make me a channel of thy peace — <br>
                                        that where there is hatred, I may bring love — <br>

                                        that where there is discord, I may bring harmony — <br>
                                        that where there is error, I may bring truth — <br>
                                        that where there is doubt, I may bring faith — <br>

                                        It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. <br>
                                        It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.
